# THE BIN5.0 ENVIRONMENT 

Recycling is so easy to do, yet people still don't do it. The Bin5.0 Environment changes this, introducing new ways to make recycling easier, and seamlessly integrated into your day to day life in the palm of your hand. Inspired by the apple eco-system, we decided to create a variety of products that compliment each other in achieving the end goal of encouraging recycling.

## The Bin5.0

The Bin5.0 is an auto-sorting Smart Sorter. This is thanks to our Smart Bin Sorter. With our Smart Bin Cap, we can transform any bin into a Smart Bin that is capable of sorting recyclable trash into three distinct groups - plastic, glass, and metal. It does it automatically for the user, so all they have to do is place their trash into the bin and it will sort it automatically for them, removing the potential for human error and negligence.

The best part is that this Smart Bin Sorter can actually be removed and fitted into any recycling bin, adding to the versatility of the product. 

The Bin5.0 is built using the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and sustainable and reused materials such as old cardboard, to create an easily-replicable, simple yet effective smart sorting system. The RasPi leveraged Google Vision to identify the item, and then the Arduino is connected to various servo motors which rotate the cap, and then drop the cap when rotated.

## The Bin5.0 Website 

The Bin5.0 Website leverages Singapore Government APIs to help people locate the nearest recycling bin to them. This website also includes a platform game developed using PyGames to help teach what materials are recyclable and what isn't. This will make recycling easy for users, and fun for educative purposes.
